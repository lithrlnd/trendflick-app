## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Flicks Page Video-Only Display
The Flicks page has been modified to display videos only by implementing proper filtering in the ViewModel:

```kotlin
// FlicksViewModel.kt
fun loadVideos() {
    viewModelScope.launch {
        try {
            _isLoading.value = true
            
            // Filter to only include videos
            val videoList = repository.getPosts().filter { it.isVideo }
            _videos.value = videoList
            
            if (videoList.isNotEmpty() && _currentVideoIndex.value >= videoList.size) {
                _currentVideoIndex.value = 0
            }
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            // Error handling
        } finally {
            _isLoading.value = false
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Engagement Column Functionality
A comprehensive EngagementColumn component has been implemented to handle likes, comments, and replies:

```kotlin
// EngagementColumn.kt
@Composable
fun EngagementColumn(
    post: Post,
    onLikeClick: () -> Unit,
    onCommentClick: () -> Unit,
    onShareClick: () -> Unit,
    onProfileClick: () -> Unit,
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier
) {
    Column(
        modifier = modifier
            .fillMaxHeight()
            .padding(16.dp),
        horizontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally,
        verticalArrangement = Arrangement.Bottom
    ) {
        // Profile avatar
        // Like button
        // Comment button
        // Share button
        // Additional actions
    }
}
```

### 3. Landscape Mode Optimization
A FlicksScreenWrapper has been implemented to automatically detect orientation changes and provide a smooth horizontal swiping experience:

```kotlin
// FlicksScreenWrapper.kt
@Composable
fun FlicksScreenWrapper(
    navController: NavController,
    viewModel: FlicksViewModel = hiltViewModel()
) {
    // Get current orientation
    val configuration = LocalConfiguration.current
    val isLandscape = configuration.orientation == Configuration.ORIENTATION_LANDSCAPE
    
    // Use appropriate screen based on orientation
    if (isLandscape) {
        LandscapeFlicksScreen(navController = navController, viewModel = viewModel)
    } else {
        FlicksScreen(navController = navController, viewModel = viewModel)
    }
}
```

### 4. Profile Navigation and Follow Buttons
The ProfileScreen has been enhanced with proper user data display, follow/unfollow buttons, and navigation:

```kotlin
// ProfileScreen.kt
@Composable
fun ProfileScreen(
    navController: NavController,
    username: String? = null,
    viewModel: ProfileViewModel = hiltViewModel()
) {
    // User profile data
    // Follow/unfollow buttons
    // Tab navigation for different content types
    // Content display based on selected tab
}
```

### 5. Rich Text Selection for Hashtags
Enhanced rich text components have been implemented to ensure hashtags and mentions are always selectable and clickable:

```kotlin
// RichTextEditor.kt
@Composable
fun EnhancedRichTextDisplay(
    text: String,
    onHashtagClick: (String) -> Unit,
    onMentionClick: (String) -> Unit,
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    textStyle: TextStyle = LocalTextStyle.current.copy(color = Color.White)
) {
    // Build annotated string with highlighted hashtags and mentions
    // Handle text selection and clicks on hashtags/mentions
}
```

### 6. Embedded Content Display
Components for properly displaying different types of embedded content have been implemented:

```kotlin
// EmbeddedContent.kt
@Composable
fun EmbeddedContent(
    post: Post,
    onPostClick: () -> Unit = {},
    onHashtagClick: (String) -> Unit = {},
    onMentionClick: (String) -> Unit = {},
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier
) {
    // Handle embedded post (repost/quote)
    // Handle link preview
}
```

### 7. Tagging and Suggestions System
A comprehensive tagging system with hashtag and user mention suggestions has been implemented:

```kotlin
// SuggestionComponents.kt
@Composable
fun HashtagSuggestions(
    query: String,
    onHashtagSelected: (String) -> Unit,
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier
) {
    // Display hashtag suggestions based on query
    // Handle hashtag selection
}

@Composable
fun UserSuggestions(
    query: String,
    onUserSelected: (UserSuggestion) -> Unit,
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier
) {
    // Display user suggestions based on query
    // Handle user selection
}
```

### 8. Hashtag Functionality
A dedicated HashtagScreen has been implemented for displaying posts with specific hashtags:

```kotlin
// HashtagScreen.kt
@Composable
fun HashtagScreen(
    navController: NavController,
    hashtag: String,
    viewModel: HashtagViewModel = hiltViewModel()
) {
    // Display posts with the specified hashtag
    // Tab navigation for different views (Top, Latest, Videos, Photos)
    // Related hashtags suggestions
}
```

## Testing and Validation
All improvements have been tested and validated to ensure proper functionality. Utility classes have been implemented for permissions, date formatting, and debugging to facilitate testing and ensure the app functions correctly.
