## Video Upload Issue
**Status**: Unresolved
**Error**: `Object does not exist at location` when attempting to upload videos to Firebase Storage

### Problem Description
- Videos fail to upload to Firebase Storage with error "Object does not exist at location"
- Error occurs at 0% upload progress
- File is successfully read from device but fails during Firebase upload
- Both recorded videos and gallery uploads experience the same issue

### Current Implementation
```kotlin
// Current upload path
Reference Path: /videos/tf_[timestamp].mp4
Full Storage Path: gs://trendflick-d7188.appspot.com/videos/tf_[timestamp].mp4
```

### What Works
- ‚úÖ File reading from device (12.2MB successfully read)
- ‚úÖ File descriptor validation
- ‚úÖ MIME type detection
- ‚úÖ Storage bucket connection
- ‚úÖ Test video function with pre-uploaded video

### What Doesn't Work
- ‚ùå Upload always fails at 0% progress
- ‚ùå Creating empty file at path fails
- ‚ùå Both putFile() and putBytes() methods fail
- ‚ùå Videos don't appear in feed even after manual upload

### Troubleshooting Steps Taken
1. Verified Firebase Storage rules (currently open for testing)
2. Confirmed file access and reading from device
3. Tried multiple upload methods:
   - putFile() with URI
   - putStream() with InputStream
   - putBytes() with ByteArray
4. Added detailed logging throughout the process
5. Attempted to create directory structure first
6. Verified storage bucket name and paths
7. Tested with both recorded and gallery videos

### Potential Causes
1. **Path Creation**: Firebase may not be able to create the path structure automatically
2. **File Access**: Firebase Storage might not have correct permissions to access the file location
3. **URI Format**: The file:// URI scheme might not be compatible with Firebase Storage
4. **Storage Configuration**: Potential mismatch between app configuration and Firebase project

### Next Steps to Try
1. Create the videos directory manually in Firebase Console
2. Try uploading directly to root instead of /videos folder
3. Convert file:// URI to content:// URI before upload
4. Verify Firebase initialization in the app

### Relevant Code Sections
1. Upload Function: `VideoRepositoryImpl.kt:uploadVideo()`
2. Storage Path: `/videos/tf_[timestamp].mp4`
3. Test Function: `testVideoInFolder()`

### Environment Details
- Device: Samsung Ultra 24
- Android Version: Latest
- Firebase Storage Bucket: trendflick-d7188.appspot.com
- File Location: /data/user/0/com.trendflick/files/

### What We've Done
1. Verified Firebase Storage Rules:
   - Set to allow all read/write operations for testing
   - Rules are correctly configured for path matching

2. Modified Video Upload Code:
   - Simplified the upload path to `videos/$filename`
   - Removed storage verification checks
   - Added detailed logging
   - Ensured proper metadata setting
   - Separated BlueSky posting from basic upload functionality

3. Authentication Changes:
   - Removed Firebase Auth requirement for uploads
   - Made BlueSky authentication optional (only when posting to BlueSky)
   - Toggle for BlueSky posting works correctly

### Current Setup
1. Storage Configuration:
   - Bucket: `trendflick-d7188.appspot.com`
   - Upload path: `/videos/{filename}`
   - Content type: `video/mp4`

2. Storage Rules:
```
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

### Current Error
```
ERROR: Object does not exist at location.
STACK: com.google.firebase.storage.StorageException: Object does not exist at location.
```

### Next Steps to Try
1. Verify Firebase Storage is properly initialized in the app
2. Test manual upload through Firebase Console
3. Check if the video file is accessible and valid before upload
4. Verify the storage bucket is correctly configured in `google-services.json`
5. Consider implementing retry logic for failed uploads

### Questions to Answer
1. Can we manually upload files through Firebase Console?
2. What is the size of the video being uploaded?
3. Is the video URI valid and accessible?
4. Is Firebase Storage properly initialized in the app?

# TrendFlick Issues & Troubleshooting Log

## Current Major Issues

### 1. Firebase Storage Upload Issue
**Status**: üî¥ Unresolved
**Error**: "Object does not exist at location" (StorageException code: -13010)

#### What Works
- ‚úÖ Manual uploads through Firebase Console
- ‚úÖ PowerShell script uploads
- ‚úÖ Firebase Authentication (Anonymous)
- ‚úÖ Firebase initialization
- ‚úÖ File access and reading
- ‚úÖ Storage rules (set to allow everything)

#### What We've Tried
1. **Upload Methods**:
   - ‚ùå `putFile(uri)` - Immediate failure
   - ‚ùå `putStream(inputStream)` - Immediate failure
   - ‚ùå `putBytes(bytes)` - Immediate failure

2. **Path Construction**:
   - ‚ùå Using `child()` method
   - ‚ùå Using `getReference()` directly
   - ‚ùå Different path formats (with/without slashes)

3. **Authentication Verification**:
   - ‚úÖ Confirmed anonymous auth working
   - ‚úÖ User ID present: `ErhxN1pol2OaYgYWBLsKftfCooG3`

4. **Firebase Configuration**:
   - ‚úÖ Storage bucket verified: `trendflick-d7188.appspot.com`
   - ‚úÖ Project ID matches
   - ‚úÖ App initialization successful

5. **File Handling**:
   - ‚úÖ File existence verified
   - ‚úÖ File readability confirmed
   - ‚úÖ Correct file size confirmed

#### Key Observations
1. Error occurs immediately (no actual upload attempt)
2. Error is consistent across all upload methods
3. All components work individually:
   - Firebase initialization successful
   - File access works
   - Authentication works
   - Permissions are correct
   - Manual uploads succeed

#### Current Theory
The issue appears to be specific to how Firebase Storage's Android SDK interprets the upload request, rather than any individual component (auth, paths, permissions, etc.).

#### Next Steps to Consider
1. Investigate SDK initialization specifics
2. Look for Android-specific Firebase Storage settings
3. Consider SDK version compatibility
4. Review Android-specific Firebase Storage documentation

#### Logs Reference

# Firebase Storage Upload Issues

## Current Issue
- Video uploads failing with error "Object does not exist at location" (Error Code: -13010, HTTP: 404)
- Upload process stops immediately after starting (0% progress)

## Environment
- Firebase Storage Rules: Full read/write access
```
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;  // Testing configuration
    }
  }
}
```

## What Works
- Manual file uploads to Firebase Storage console
- Small test file uploads
- Text file uploads to both root and /videos directory
- Reading existing files from storage

## Attempted Solutions

### 1. Directory Verification
- Tried creating /videos directory explicitly
- Attempted to create .keep marker file
- Removed directory verification since Firebase creates directories automatically

### 2. Upload Flow Modifications
- Modified upload sequence to:
  1. Upload file with basic metadata
  2. Track progress
  3. Verify upload completion
  4. Verify storage metadata
  5. Get download URL
  6. Save to Firestore

### 3. Content URI Handling
- Added proper ContentResolver usage
- Added data verification before upload
- Added detailed logging of URI and file data

### 4. Metadata Handling
- Added proper metadata verification
- Ensured metadata is verified before getting download URL
- Added detailed logging of metadata status

### 5. Error Handling
- Added comprehensive error logging
- Added upload progress tracking
- Added upload state verification

### 6. UI Changes
- Made description optional when not posting to BlueSky
- Added upload progress indicators
- Added better error messaging

## Next Steps
1. Verify file data is being read correctly from ContentResolver
2. Check if file data is actually being sent to Firebase
3. Consider testing direct upload to root directory first
4. Add more detailed logging around the initial upload attempt

## Notes
- Firebase Storage rules are correctly configured
- Authentication is working (verified in logs)
- Manual uploads work, suggesting the issue is in the upload process rather than permissions 

### 2. Description Handling in Video Posts
**Status**: üî¥ Unresolved
**Impact**: Description requirement blocking non-BlueSky posts

#### Current Behavior
- Description field is tightly coupled with video metadata
- Backend still expects description even when posting only to TrendFlick
- UI shows description as optional but backend coupling remains

#### What Works
- ‚úÖ UI correctly shows description as optional when BlueSky is off
- ‚úÖ Button enables correctly based on BlueSky toggle
- ‚úÖ Default title "TrendFlick Video" implemented for empty descriptions

#### What Needs Fixing
- Backend still tightly couples description with video metadata
- Video object creation needs to better handle empty descriptions
- Need to ensure consistent handling throughout the upload flow
- Firestore storage should properly handle null/empty descriptions

#### Technical Details
- Current implementation in `VideoRepositoryImpl.kt` and `UploadViewModel.kt`
- Description field used in multiple places:
  1. Video metadata creation
  2. Firestore document storage
  3. Title generation
  4. BlueSky post creation

#### Next Steps
1. Review all places where description is used in the codebase
2. Ensure proper null/empty handling in Firestore
3. Update video object creation to handle empty descriptions
4. Maintain AT Protocol compliance for BlueSky posts
5. Add validation to ensure description only required for BlueSky posts 

### Issue #3: Like Button State Persistence
**Status**: Unresolved
**Impact**: High - User experience degradation

**Description**:
The like button UI state is not persisting correctly across app sessions. When a user likes a post:
- Button turns purple to indicate "liked" state ‚úÖ
- State resets when app is closed and reopened ‚ùå
- Requires re-liking posts after app restart

**Technical Details**:
- AT Protocol like records are being created but not properly synced on app restart
- Local state management in `HomeViewModel` needs to be aligned with AT Protocol state
- Current implementation in `AtProtocolRepositoryImpl.kt` and `HomeViewModel.kt`

**Next Steps**:
1. Review AT Protocol like record persistence
2. Implement proper state restoration on app launch
3. Ensure synchronization between local UI state and AT Protocol records
4. Add state verification on app initialization

**Related Components**:
- `HomeViewModel.kt`: Like state management
- `AtProtocolRepositoryImpl.kt`: AT Protocol integration
- `ThreadCard.kt`: UI implementation

## Resolved Issues

### 3. Comment Functionality Issues
**Status**: Unresolved
**Impact**: Users cannot effectively comment or reply in the comment section

#### Problem Description
1. Comment Section:
   - Unable to post comments or replies in the comment section
   - Character limit (300 characters per BlueSky AT Protocol) not visibly displayed
   - No visual feedback on remaining characters while typing

#### Technical Details
- Location: `CommentDialog.kt` and `HomeScreen.kt`
- Current Implementation:
  - Comment input exists but lacks proper character limit display
  - Reply functionality not properly connected
  - Missing visual feedback for character count

#### What Works
- Comment section UI displays correctly
- Comment button opens the comment overlay
- Basic text input functionality

#### What Needs Fixing
1. Comment Input:
   - Add visible 300-character limit counter
   - Implement character countdown in input box
   - Add visual feedback when approaching limit
2. Reply Functionality:
   - Connect reply button actions
   - Ensure proper nesting of replies
   - Maintain AT Protocol compliance for replies

#### Next Steps
1. Update CommentDialog.kt to:
   - Display character count (0/300)
   - Add visual indicator for remaining characters
   - Implement color changes when approaching limit
2. Implement proper reply functionality:
   - Connect reply buttons to action handlers
   - Ensure proper threading of replies
   - Maintain BlueSky AT Protocol standards
